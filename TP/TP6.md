# Adapter

## Definition
Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. An a adapter's basic function is to serve as an interface between two objects that can't comunicate becase of the types of data evolved.

## Structure
An adpter can be implemented for an object or for a class:
- ### Object Adapter
    - An object adapter uses composition to adapt the interface of an adaptee class to the target interface that the client expects. This means the adapter contains an instance of the class it adapts.
- ### Class Adapter
    - A class adapter uses multiple interfaces to adapt one interface to another. It inherits privately from the adaptee and implements the target interface that the client expects.

## Exemple
```java
class RoundHole is
    constructor RoundHole(radius) { ... }

    method getRadius() is
        // Return the radius of the hole.

    method fits(peg: RoundPeg) is
        return this.getRadius() >= peg.getRadius()

class RoundPeg is
    constructor RoundPeg(radius) { ... }

    method getRadius() is
        // Return the radius of the peg.


// But there's an incompatible class: SquarePeg.
class SquarePeg is
    constructor SquarePeg(width) { ... }

    method getWidth() is
        // Return the square peg width.


// An adapter class lets you fit square pegs into round holes.
// It extends the RoundPeg class to let the adapter objects act
// as round pegs.
class SquarePegAdapter extends RoundPeg is
    // In reality, the adapter contains an instance of the
    // SquarePeg class.
    private field peg: SquarePeg

    constructor SquarePegAdapter(peg: SquarePeg) is
        this.peg = peg

    method getRadius() is
        // The adapter pretends that it's a round peg with a
        // radius that could fit the square peg that the adapter
        // actually wraps.
        return peg.getWidth() * Math.sqrt(2) / 2
```


# Bridge

## Definition
Bridge is a Structural Design Pattern. The role of this Pattern is to seperate a large class or two closely related ones into two seperated hierarchies - abstraction and implementation.

## Structure
### Abstraction 
The abstraction is the core of this pattern. It's work is to define the abstractions interface, having a reference to the object it is implementing. The abstraction can be an interface or a abstract class.
### Implementor
This class will be an interface for the implementation classes. The Implementator will provide the basic operations that the abstraction will use.

## Example
``` java
// The "abstraction" defines the interface for the "control"
// part of the two class hierarchies. It maintains a reference
// to an object of the "implementation" hierarchy and delegates
// all of the real work to this object.
class RemoteControl is
    protected field device: Device
    constructor RemoteControl(device: Device) is
        this.device = device
    method togglePower() is
        if (device.isEnabled()) then
            device.disable()
        else
            device.enable()
    method volumeDown() is
        device.setVolume(device.getVolume() - 10)
    method volumeUp() is
        device.setVolume(device.getVolume() + 10)
    method channelDown() is
        device.setChannel(device.getChannel() - 1)
    method channelUp() is
        device.setChannel(device.getChannel() + 1)


// You can extend classes from the abstraction hierarchy
// independently from device classes.
class AdvancedRemoteControl extends RemoteControl is
    method mute() is
        device.setVolume(0)


// The "implementation" interface declares methods common to all
// concrete implementation classes. It doesn't have to match the
// abstraction's interface. In fact, the two interfaces can be
// entirely different. Typically the implementation interface
// provides only primitive operations, while the abstraction
// defines higher-level operations based on those primitives.
interface Device is
    method isEnabled()
    method enable()
    method disable()
    method getVolume()
    method setVolume(percent)
    method getChannel()
    method setChannel(channel)


// All devices follow the same interface.
class Tv implements Device is
    // ...

class Radio implements Device is
    // ...


// Somewhere in client code.
tv = new Tv()
remote = new RemoteControl(tv)
remote.togglePower()

radio = new Radio()
remote = new AdvancedRemoteControl(radio)
